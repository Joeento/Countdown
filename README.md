A friend of mine lamented that he would like to countdown the days he had left until he finished grad school, but couldn't find any countdown apps that didn't drain  his battery.  seeing it as an opportunity to finally learn node, git, AWS, and MongoDB, I offered to make him a web app that'll work just as well.  Here it is.  (there will be a better README later too, promise).
